Explanation of the Approach
HTML
The HTML structure consists of a div with the class gallery containing multiple div elements with the class gallery-item. Each gallery-item has an image and a div with class details for the image description. A lightbox div is included for displaying full-size images.

CSS
Responsive Design: The gallery class uses flex layout to ensure the items are displayed in a row and allows horizontal scrolling if necessary.
Hover Effects: Smooth transitions are added for hover effects on images and details using CSS transitions.
Lightbox: The lightbox is styled as a modal with animations for zoom effect and smooth opening and closing transitions.
JavaScript
The JavaScript code handles the interaction logic:

Hover Effects: JavaScript adds and removes the hover class on gallery items to trigger CSS transitions.
Lightbox: When a gallery item is clicked, the full-size image is displayed in a lightbox. The lightbox can be closed by clicking the close button or anywhere outside the image.
Customization
You can customize the gallery by:

Adding or removing images in the images folder.
Updating the index.html file to include new gallery items.
Modifying the style.css file to change the appearance and animations.
Enhancing the script.js file to add more interactions or features.
